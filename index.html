        <p style ="color: hotpink; font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-size: 20px;">Alan Mathison Turing was born on 23rd june 1912 in Maida Vale, London. In his primary school (St Michael's) it was obvious he was excenteric since the young age of nine,  when his headmistress stated, ‘I have had clever boys and hard-working boys, but Alan is a genius’. Alan even had a (fairly) rough time as he had to change schools twice. In his second school, he became intriuged with chess, using hours up working out complex chess conundrums in solitary.</p><br>

        <p style ="color: white; font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-size: 24px">Alan's main proffesion was a mathematition who cracked the german code: the Enigma. An asset to britan in WWI, Turing cracked the code with his own computer- the bombe machine. He worked at bletchey park in London alongside his team/advisors.  His was the firs team to face the hardest German code yet so a new computer was made(the one I mentioned before- the Bombe Machine). ¨The Bombes were 7ft wide, 6ft 6in tall and weighed a ton – literally¨. This massive machine worked by having many dials with the alphabet on each and if it received a positive signal a light would light up. <br> Turings life may seem great and all but he couldn´t cope with the presssure of being gay (yes, he was gay) so he suicide via cyonide poisoning. Because of the discrimination back in them days, clearly, great minds and international heroes have been lost.
